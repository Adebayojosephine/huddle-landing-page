# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with alternating feature blocks

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Built out this landing page and got it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users will be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

**Had fun building this!** ðŸš€
